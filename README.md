# Language User Interface
LUI runs in your browser, so you can use it on both laptops and mobile devices. Think: a simple version of [JARVIS](http://marvel-movies.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.).

LUI works completely hands-free in Chrome (versions 25+).

## To understand the code:

* A good place to start is [brain.js](https://github.com/hchiam/language-user-interface/blob/master/brain.js).

* [ear.js](https://github.com/hchiam/language-user-interface/blob/master/ear.js) lets LUI listen right away and completely hands-free in Chrome. It modifies some of the code in [brain.js](https://github.com/hchiam/language-user-interface/blob/master/brain.js).

* [add-on.js](https://github.com/hchiam/language-user-interface/blob/master/add-on.js) adds more custom functionality to LUI. It modifies some of the code in [brain.js](https://github.com/hchiam/language-user-interface/blob/master/brain.js).
